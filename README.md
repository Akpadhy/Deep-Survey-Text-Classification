# Deep-Survey-on-Text-Classification

The project surveys 16 Natural Language Processing (NLP) research papers that propose novel Deep Neural Network Models for Text Classification, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It also implements each of the models using Tensorflow and Keras.
